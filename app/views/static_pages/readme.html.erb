<h1>Elastico Example App</h1>
<h3>Hi there! This app demonstrates how to use the elastico gem</h3>

<p>
	It's quiet simple. We have an apple model, which has a name and color and we want to be able to search it.
</p>

<h3>If you cloned/forked the app</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Install and Run elasticsearch by following <%= link_to 'this link', 'http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup.html#setup-installation', :target => "_blank" %>.</li>
	<li>Run rake db:migrate</li>
	<li>Run rake db:seed</li>
	<li>Play with rails c while creating and deleting Apples. Watch how elasticsearch is updated automatically when you create or delete an instance. You can view elasticsearch indices by installing the <%= link_to 'head',"http://mobz.github.io/elasticsearch-head/", :target => "_blank" %>  plugin. </li>
	<li>Hop on to <%= link_to 'the apples index page', apples_index_path %> and play with the search.</li>
	<li>Note that the initial query only searches for colors. It will not find names. Change it to include names searching by changing the search query to "_all" instead of "color" in the apples controller. </li>
</ul>
<h3>If you are viewing the app online</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Hop on to <%= link_to 'the apples index page', apples_index_path %> and play with the search.</li>
	<li>Note that the initial query only searches for colors. It will not find names. You can change the query (and the mapping, getting ngram search available in no-time) it if you clone/fork the app, and view it locally.  </li>
</ul>
